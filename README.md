Abstract:
Based on the CSGO stats, approx. 546197 players play matches 24 hours peak, and itâ€™s 850486 for the all-time peak. Another statistic shows The Global Offensive professional scene consists tournaments hosted by third-party organisations and Valve-organised as majors. These majors have huge prize pools, originally it was set at $250,000, the prize pools for majors have risen, with MLG Columbus 2016 having the first pool of $1,000,000. It becomes important for a professional player to look forward to winning the match in competitions which can be achieved by proper analysis and prediction. In this project we desire to analyse the Average Damage per round, Kills and Deaths of each player that would further build a simple predicting model for the players in the matches.
Introduction:
We aim at building different predictive models with high accuracy which will enable us to predict the most useful player in the match. Consider an example of a random players playing as a team in a match, and they lose as they have no knowledge of other team members who are the beginners. This becomes difficult for the professional players to win the match also this can affect the overall rating of a player. In this project we will try to predict the number of Kills by a player and the ADR (Average Damage per Round) which will help us to know how useful the player is for considering in a team.

Decision diagrams and other classifiers like genetic algorithms, Bayesian and neural networks have been used for a very long time for simple classification and decision support
One of the most important aspects of building a decision tree is to determine the best split attribute-value pair for a certain data-set. Thus, at every stage in the formation of the decision tree, the attribute-value pair that gives rise to the best split of the current data-set must be determined. The importance of estimating the best split is that otherwise, the resultant tree could be longer and wider. In the worst case, the resultant tree could be a skewed one, with only one non-leaf child per node and a smaller number of records being classified at each step.
